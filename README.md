## ## Creative Custom T-Shirt Storefront

A Website developed using React, Redux Toolkit, React Three Fiber, Stripe, TypeScript, and Sass.
1. User interaction with OpenAI: Users can provide prompts that OpenAI processes to generate and return images (Currently available to administrators only), which are then stored in a gallery.
2. T-shirt visualization through Three.js: Leveraging Three.js technology, users can simulate T-shirt styles on a 3D model, with patterns and base colors of their own design.
3. Checkout and payment via Stripe: Upon completing their T-shirt design, users can checkout and make payments through Stripe.

### `yarn install` (or `npm install`)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following:

### `yarn dev` (or `npm run dev`)

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build` (or `npm run build`)
